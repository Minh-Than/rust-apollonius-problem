# rust-apollonius-problem

Trying to rewrite an existing Java project of mine in Rust to learn `egui`. Currently not finished.

## Issues:

- [x] (IMPORTANT) Inverse poles aren't being shown / calculated properly
- [ ] Finish the rest of the components for calculating Apollonius circles
- [ ] Fix circle selection handling issue due to overlapping unique allocating rects
